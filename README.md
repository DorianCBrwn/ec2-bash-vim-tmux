There are three aspects to this setup:
- Edit/navigate and run code in the same window simultaneously using
  [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).
- Develop code with [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), configured with popular
  plugins and sensible defaults.
- Enable directory navigation and display git branch/status with [Oh My
